#### A personal portfolio project

#### By **Jessie Waite**

## Description

A personal portfolio project for week 4 of Epicodus CSS track.The website was made using HTML and CSS only, to demonstrate my abilities to use sass(scss), flex-boxes, animations, and transitions. Currently, there is only one animation and transition, but more will be added to the project as it further develops for my personal use. There are three break-points. One at a maximum width of 800px and the other at a maximum of 500px.

##Requirements met:
* _Flexbox is used for at least three major elements_
* _Project is built using Sass (I used SCSS)_
* _Page is responsive_
* _At least one example of a transition_
* _At least one example of transform or animation_
* _Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state_


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the "google" repository to your desktop from GitHub here: https://github.com/jbellwaite/jbw-portfolio.git_
* _Open the "google" folder_
* _Open a web-browser, preferably Chrome._
* _Drag "index.html" into an open tab in your web browser to open the application._

## Known Bugs

* _When the user hovers their mouse over the icon in the header (the triangle), the text background color gradually changes. However, as soon as you move the mouse away, the border radius around the box is removed, and becomes square for a second or two while the color fades away._

## Technologies Used
  * CSS
  * HTML
